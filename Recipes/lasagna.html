    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of lasagna noodles, meat sauce, ricotta cheese mixture, and
    mozzarella cheese, baked until golden brown and bubbly. It's a hearty and flavorful casserole perfect for a comforting
    meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles (enough to cover your baking dish in a single layer)</li>
        <li>Ground beef or sausage (optional, can be vegetarian)</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Onion, garlic, and other spices like oregano, basil, and thyme</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs (for mixing with ricotta)</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded or sliced</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Meat Sauce (Optional): Brown ground beef or sausage with chopped onions and garlic. Drain any fat. Add crushed
        tomatoes, tomato paste, and your desired spices. Simmer for at least 30 minutes to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package
        instructions until al dente (slightly firm to the bite). Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: Combine ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Season
        with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce (if using) in the bottom of
        a baking dish. Top with a layer of noodles, then ricotta mixture, and shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers, ending
        with mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the lasagna with foil (optional) and bake for 20-25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes,
        or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let Rest and Serve: Allow the lasagna to rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving. This lets the flavors
        meld and the cheese set.</li>
    </ol>
